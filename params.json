  "body": "# What is \"The Ion Project\"?\r\n*The Ion Project* is a project containing **Proton**, **Neutron**, and **Electron**. These are created using *Skript 2.2* and *skQuery* only, I try to stay away from other addons.\r\n\r\n# What are some of the features?\r\nSome of the features inside of **Ion** are mostly commands & features that most people would like to have some customization about. Luckily, **Ion** can do just that.\r\n\r\nEach section of *Ion* is broken up into *three parts*. First, there is **Proton**, the main & central core of *Ion*, mostly containing commands like `/gm c`, `/tphere` & `/tpcoords`.\r\n\r\n**Neutron** currently is the chat category for *Ion*. It allows for creating chat groups, editing the prefixes & suffixes, all in game. Everything in **Neutron**, just like *Proton*, is completely customizable.\r\n\r\nCurrently, **Electron** has no main use; still thinking of a use for it.\r\n\r\n# Wiki\r\n\r\nCheck out the **Wiki** [*here*](https://github.com/Vehicola/ion-project/wiki). The Wiki shows you how to use the commands and permissions, and as well as how to customize **Proton** & **Neutron**.\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nTo install **Proton** or **Neutron**, download `proton.sk` or `neutron.sk`, [Skript](https://forums.skunity.com/uploads/default/original/2X/a/af5cf8410e58cce7f76c8fc467498b32c37e2755.jar), & [skQuery](http://skquery.net/artifacts/ba5a69c/SkQuery.jar). After downloading these, place `Skript-2.2-Vb8.jar` & `skQuery.jar` in `plugins/`. Start up your server, and check if they have installed *(Execute /plugins to see)*. After so, find `plugins/Skript/scripts/` and place `proton.sk` or `neutron.sk` into the folder. After so, execute `/sk reload proton.sk` or `/sk reload neutron.sk`. Proton/Neutron will then load up and work as told.\r\n",
