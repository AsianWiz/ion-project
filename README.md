# What is "The Ion Project"?
*The Ion Project* is a project containing **Proton**, **Neutron**, and **Electron**. These are created using *Skript 2.2* and *skQuery* only, I try to stay away from other addons.

## What are some of the features?
Some of the features inside of **Ion** are mostly commands & features that most people would like to have some customization about. Luckily, **Ion** can do just that.

Each section of *Ion* is broken up into *three parts*. First, there is **Proton**, the main & central core of *Ion*, mostly containing commands like `/gm c`, `/tphere` & `/tpcoords`.

**Neutron** currently is the chat category for *Ion*. It allows for creating chat groups, editing the prefixes & suffixes, all in game. Everything in **Neutron**, just like *Proton*, is completely customizable.

Currently, **Electron** has no main use; still thinking of a use for it
